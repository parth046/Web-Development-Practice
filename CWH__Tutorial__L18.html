        <h1>Colors in CSS </h1>

        we can give colors in elements by 3 ways 

        1.  we can give color by going in style and write a particular elements ID and then writing color and then name of that color 

        2.  we can give color by going in style of a particular element then write color and then RGB and then give values to RGB 
        
        3.  we give color by going in style of a particular element them write color and then # and then code of that color [ # is hexa decimal values for color ] We search on Google the hexa value of color
