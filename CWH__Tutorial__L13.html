    <h3>we are learning about CSS </h3>

    we add CSS in our html code throught 3 ways

    1. inline CSS it means adding the CSS in that perticular Element [ EX :

    2. External CSS it means we make a seperate file for CSS and then add that file in Head Tag

    3. internal CSS it means we write the CSS in Head Tag

    <p style="color: red;background-color: yellow;">inline CSS</p>

   <h1> Important Note :  </h1> 
 
    what we have written at last has the precedence [ prefered ]

    EX : we have a External CSS file and we have a internal CSS written in STYLE Tag inside Head Tag

    if the internal CSS is written after the the link of EXTERNAL CSS then the internal CSS has the prefernce

    but if the link of External CSS is written after the internal CSS then the EXTERNAL CSS has the prefernce

    <h1> Very important Note </h1>

    inline CSS has the most prefernce 

    BUt if you want some particular Code to important just write  !important in that CSS Code
